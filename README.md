UUF World Buff Filter allows you to hide unwanted world and miscellaneous buffs from the Player frame in Unhalted Unit Frames (UUF) using a customizable SpellID blacklist.

It is designed for players who want a clean buff display and prefer to see only relevant combat, class, or raid buffs while hiding temporary world effects, holiday buffs, zone effects, or other clutter.

Note: This does not work for buffs you get while in combat. Buffs you had before combat will stay hidden  (Timewalking, Long-Duration buffs, Tabard etc.)

 
What It Does
This addon hooks into UUF’s Player Buff container and filters out specific auras based on their SpellID.

If a buff’s SpellID is on your blacklist, it will not be shown in UUF’s Player frame.
